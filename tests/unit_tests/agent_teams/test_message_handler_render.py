"""Tests for ``MessageHandler._format_message`` inbound rendering.

``_format_message`` turns one mailbox row into the ``<team-inbound>`` XML an
agent reads. The method itself depends only on the message fields, the i18n
table, and the pure renderer (no ``self._infra`` / ``self._blueprint``), so
the handler is instantiated via ``object.__new__`` to avoid the full
coordination wiring. The HITT path is covered as a regression guard: a
human-agent avatar must be told to stay silent, and that constraint must keep
its load-bearing wording.
