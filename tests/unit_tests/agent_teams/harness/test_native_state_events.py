"""NativeHarness lifecycle events (harness.state / harness.round) and resume.

These cover the stage-2 base layer: the harness fires phase and round events on
its private callback framework so a consumer (the team StreamController) can map
them onto MemberStatus / ExecutionStatus without polling, and a ``send`` of an
``InteractiveInput`` resumes an interrupted turn through the same ``submit_round``
path (the executor extracts the InteractiveInput and the inner ReAct agent
resumes).

Events fire inside the supervisor coroutine, so the recorded ordering matches
the real phase/round transitions exactly. Callbacks declare only the kwargs they
need (the framework narrows the payload), which these tests exercise directly.
