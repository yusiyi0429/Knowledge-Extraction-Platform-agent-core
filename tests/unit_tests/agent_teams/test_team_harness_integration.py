"""End-to-end integration over the adopted TeamHarness + StreamController chain.

Unlike ``test_stream_controller`` (which drives a fake MemberRuntime), these
tests wire the **real** TeamHarness — composing a **real** NativeHarness over the
real task-loop kernel — to a **real** StreamController, and drive the full chain:

    harness.start(team_session) -> stream_controller.start()
        -> harness.send(query) -> native supervisor runs a round
        -> native.outputs() chunks -> StreamController._forward_outputs
        -> TeamOutputSchema tagged into stream_queue
        -> harness phase/round events -> _map_state / _map_round

The only fake is the inner ``react_agent`` (the LLM), injected after start via
the shared NativeHarness fixtures — the same seam the stage-A native tests use.
This exercises the collection logic the unit tests stub out: that the team layer
really forwards a live native's stream and maps its real phase/round events.
