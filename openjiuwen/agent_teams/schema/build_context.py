"""Runtime carrier threaded into ``spec.build()`` for provider-based assembly.

``BuildContext`` holds the live, non-serializable handles a capability
provider needs to materialize a rail / tool / sub-agent (resolved workspace,
member identity, and platform-specific handles attached by subclasses).  It
is deliberately NOT a Pydantic model: like ``TeamRuntimeContext`` it is a
Spec -> Runtime boundary object and never participates in JSON serialization.

Platforms subclass it to add typed handles (preferred); the generic
``extras`` mapping is an escape hatch for stacking multiple platforms.
