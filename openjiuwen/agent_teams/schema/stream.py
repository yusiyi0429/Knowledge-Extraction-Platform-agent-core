"""Team-layer streaming schema extensions.

Subclassing :class:`OutputSchema` keeps the core stream layer free of
team-specific fields while letting team-layer consumers attribute each
chunk to the member that produced it (leader or in-process teammate).

Non-team producers (single agent, harness direct streaming) continue to
yield plain ``OutputSchema`` instances.
