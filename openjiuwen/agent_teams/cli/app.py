"""Public entry point for the Team CLI.

:func:`run_team_cli` is the single async entry the SDK exposes for
embedding the interactive CLI inside another application. It builds a
:class:`SpecRegistry` from the supplied YAML paths and / or in-memory
``TeamAgentSpec`` dict, brings up :class:`Runner`, drives
:class:`TeamCli` to completion, and tears everything down on exit.

Callers who already manage ``Runner.start()`` / ``Runner.stop()``
themselves (e.g. inside a larger framework) should instantiate
``TeamCli`` directly — this helper exists for the ``examples/``
launcher and small standalone tools.
