"""Render HumanAgentInboundEvent notifications into the CLI console.

``Runner.register_human_agent_inbound`` accepts an async callback that
the runtime fires for every team-side message addressed to a registered
human-agent member. The CLI delegates that callback to
:func:`make_inbox_callback` which formats the event into a rich-styled
line and prints it through the same console used by the stream renderer
— prompt_toolkit's ``patch_stdout`` keeps the input area intact.
