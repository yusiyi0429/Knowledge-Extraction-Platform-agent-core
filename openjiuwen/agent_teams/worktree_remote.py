"""Distributed worktree backend for remote nodes (team-specific).

Enables worktree isolation across machines: the leader sends worktree
lifecycle requests via ``Messager``; each remote node maintains its own
shallow clone and creates local worktrees within it.

This module is team-specific because it depends on the team's storage
layout (``agent_teams.paths.get_agent_teams_home``) for shallow-clone
caching. The generic worktree manager / backend protocol live in
``openjiuwen.harness.tools.worktree``.

Importing this module has no side effect on the harness backend
registry — callers that need a remote backend instantiate
``RemoteWorktreeBackend(config, messager, node_id)`` directly and pass
it as the ``backend=`` argument when constructing ``WorktreeManager``.
