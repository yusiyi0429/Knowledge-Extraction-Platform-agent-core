"""TeamToolRail — register team coordination tools onto the DeepAgent.

Mirrors the pattern of :class:`SysOperationRail` / :class:`McpRail` /
:class:`LspRail`: the rail's ``init`` constructs the role-appropriate
team tools (coordination, messaging, task, optional workspace extras)
and wires their ``ToolCard``s into the agent's shared ``ability_manager``,
while registering the runtime instances on ``Runner.resource_mgr`` so the
dispatcher can resolve invocations.

Centralising team tool registration in a Rail keeps the team tool
surface aligned with how every other DeepAgent capability is mounted,
and lets ``uninit`` cleanly tear the surface back down on rail removal
or hot reconfigure.
