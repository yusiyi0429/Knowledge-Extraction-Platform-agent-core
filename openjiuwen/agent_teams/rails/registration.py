"""Register openjiuwen's built-in harness elements into the provider registries.

``ensure_harness_elements_registered`` imports the built-in element
declarations (populating the manifest catalog) and drives provider registration
from it. It is the single entry the spec build path (``RailSpec.build`` /
``BuiltinToolSpec.build``) calls before resolving a ``type`` to a provider, now
that the class registries are gone. Idempotent: only the first call does work.
