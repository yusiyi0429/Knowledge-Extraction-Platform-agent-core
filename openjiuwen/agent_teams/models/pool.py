"""Model pool entries and pool-refresh helpers.

A team's ``model_pool`` is the canonical multi-endpoint deployment
shape: a list of LLM endpoints with credentials and provider info that
``ModelAllocator`` distributes across leader and teammates so concurrent
calls spread across endpoints instead of saturating a single one.

Two identifiers anchor the design:

* ``ModelPoolEntry.model_id`` — process-local client identity, surfaced
  as ``ModelClientConfig.client_id`` for foundation client deduplication.
  Auto-generated, never persisted, regenerated on every pool reload.
* ``(model_name, group_index)`` — semantic persistence identity. The DB
  stores this lightweight reference; the live config is rehydrated from
  the in-session pool via ``resolve_member_model``.

``inherit_pool_ids`` is the single bridge between two pool versions: it
preserves ``model_id`` only when an old and new entry are bit-exact, so
a future foundation client cache cannot serve a stale client built
against rotated credentials.

    Pool entries describe a usable model endpoint together with the

    allocation time so each team member can talk to a different endpoint
    and avoid single-endpoint rate-limit contention.

    Two identifiers play distinct roles:

    * ``model_id`` (auto-uuid): runtime client identity. Wired through to
      ``ModelClientConfig.client_id`` so the foundation layer's resource
      manager can dedupe / cache the underlying HTTP client across
      members that share the same endpoint. Never persisted to the DB
      and never crosses pool versions — regenerated each time the pool
      is reloaded from spec.
    * ``(model_name, group_index)``: semantic persistence identity.

      refreshes propagate without re-spawning members.

    * Any value change (api_key rotation, base_url migration, timeout
