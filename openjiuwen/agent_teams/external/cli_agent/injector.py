"""Side-channel input transport into a running external CLI agent.

The team delivers inbound text to a spawned CLI member by writing to the
CLI's input channel. :class:`Injector` is the abstraction; ``StdinPipeInjector``
is the first (Unix-first) backend, writing newline-framed text to the
subprocess stdin pipe. PTY / Windows backends can implement the same
Protocol later without touching the runtime.
