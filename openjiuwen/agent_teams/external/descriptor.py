"""Connection descriptor for external agents joining a team.

An external agent process (a third-party CLI such as claudecode / codex,
or an independent service) needs three things to act as a first-class team
member: where the team database lives, how to reach the team messager, and
which member identity it carries. :class:`TeamJoinDescriptor` bundles those
into one JSON-serialisable payload that the team injects through an
environment variable at spawn time, or that an operator hands to an
independent service out of band.

    """Everything an external agent needs to attach to a running team.

    Attributes:
        session_id: Session identifier used to build event topics and to
            isolate per-session dynamic tables. Must match the team's live
            session.
        team_name: Target team identifier.
        member_name: The member identity this external agent serves. The
            team must already have a registered member row under this name.
        role: Member role driving op-surface filtering. ``"teammate"``
            (default) or ``"leader"``.
        scope: External-access scenario this connection serves — orthogonal
            to ``role`` (which is a team role).
            ``"member"`` = a spawned third-party CLI acting as a first-class
            team member; it gets the native teammate tool set (the real
            ``view_task`` / ``claim_task`` / ``send_message`` team tools) so it
            is indistinguishable from an in-process teammate, and its team
            system prompt is injected directly at spawn time (so the MCP
            server exposes no extra instructions).
            ``"operator"`` (default) = an external, non-member interface that
            operates/controls the team via tools (the broad operator tool set
            + workflow instructions). The team-member spawn path sets
            ``"member"``; manually provisioned operator descriptors keep the
            default.
        language: Team runtime language (``"cn"`` or ``"en"``) used to render
            inbound message / task-board text consistently with in-process
            members.
        db_config: Team database connection. For cross-process use this must
            be a file-backed sqlite ``connection_string``; the in-memory
            backend (``MemoryDatabaseConfig``) is single-process only and is
            intended for tests.
        transport_config: Messager transport config used by the external
            client. ``external_publish_url`` is the Gateway relay WebSocket
            endpoint for standard team events.
