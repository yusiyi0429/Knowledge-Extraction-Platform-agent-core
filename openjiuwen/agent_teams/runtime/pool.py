"""In-process pool of active TeamAgent runtimes.

Replaces the single-active model with a multi-team object pool. Each
:class:`ActiveTeam` holds a TeamAgent leader instance, the session it is
currently bound to, its lifecycle state, and the :class:`InteractGate`
that gates concurrent interact deliveries.

Pool key is ``team_name`` only — a given team is bound to at most one
session at a time. Switching sessions for the same team is a hard
boundary: ``TeamRuntimeManager.activate`` tears down the stale entry
via ``stop_team`` before dispatch and the new session enters through
``CREATE`` / ``NEW_TEAM_IN_SESSION`` / ``COLD_RECOVER`` against an
empty pool slot, ensuring no in-memory state leaks across sessions.
Multi-team-per-session is supported naturally by having multiple
``ActiveTeam`` entries that share a session id.
