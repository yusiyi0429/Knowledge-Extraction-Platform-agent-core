          becomes its own bus message and ``@all`` / ``@*`` collapses

        Recipients are strict-matched against the live roster after

        no roster row is not a routing directive — its mention folds

        ``team_in_session`` comes from the checkpoint bucket; ``team_in_db``
        comes from the static team table queried via the spec's resolved
        ``DatabaseConfig``. Both reads are required by the dispatch truth
        table — the team-table query is what distinguishes CREATE from
        NEW_TEAM_IN_SESSION when the session is fresh and no warm pool
        entry exists.
