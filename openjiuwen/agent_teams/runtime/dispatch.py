"""Pure dispatch decision for ``run_agent_team_streaming``.

Resolves the (team, session, pool, checkpoint) state into one of the
documented :class:`RunActionKind` outcomes. No side effects: callers
collect the inputs (DB existence, checkpoint bucket presence, pool entry)
and let this function pick the path. The runtime manager is then free to
execute the corresponding effect (create / recover / resume / reject).

Pre-dispatch contract enforced by ``TeamRuntimeManager.activate``: any
``pool_entry`` passed in here belongs to ``target_session_id``. Cross-
session pool entries are torn down with ``stop_team`` before dispatch
runs, so this function never has to choose between "warm" and "cold"
rebuild paths — stop+remove+cold-rebuild is the only cross-session
path.
