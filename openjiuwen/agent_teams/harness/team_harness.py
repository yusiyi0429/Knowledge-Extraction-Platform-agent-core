"""TeamHarness: sole adapter between TeamAgent and a NativeHarness brain.

TeamHarness composes a single :class:`NativeHarness` (which IS-A DeepAgent and
drives the full task loop under one supervisor) and exposes the concurrent-safe
interaction surface (``start`` / ``stop`` / ``outputs`` / ``send`` / ``abort`` /
``pause`` / ``subscribe``) plus the team capability hooks the configurator /
coordination need. Replacing DeepAgent with a remote scheduling resource only
requires re-implementing this module; business code in ``agent_teams`` keeps the
same call surface.

Lifecycle: the underlying DeepAgent *configures itself* synchronously in its
constructor so the configurator can read workspace/sys_operation before any run
cycle. ``start(team_session)`` then
binds a child agent session (sharing the team session id, so DeepAgentState
persists) and spins up the supervisor; the same native instance is reused across
run cycles on the same session. A session switch tears the native down and
rebuilds it for the new session; cross-cycle state is recovered from the
persisted session id.
