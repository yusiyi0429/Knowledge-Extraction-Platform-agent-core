"""NativeHarness: concurrent-safe interaction layer that IS a DeepAgent.

NativeHarness subclasses ``DeepAgent`` and drives the full task-loop kernel
(TaskLoopController / TaskScheduler / TaskLoopEventHandler / LoopCoordinator),
so it keeps every DeepAgent capability — task plan, stop conditions,
SESSION_SPAWN subagents, BEFORE/AFTER_TASK_ITERATION rails, follow-up rounds,
interrupt/resume, plan mode, DeepAgentState management. It only replaces the
*interaction model*: instead of DeepAgent's self-driving ``while`` loop
(``_run_task_loop``), a single supervisor coroutine drives one outer round at a
time via ``submit_round`` + ``wait_round_completion`` and decides whether to
continue using the same multi-round rules.

Why inherit instead of compose: the task-loop executor calls
``agent.react_agent.invoke(...)`` and fires BEFORE/AFTER_TASK_ITERATION on
``agent`` — both must resolve to *this* harness. A composed wrapper that calls
``react_agent.invoke`` directly would bypass the executor (and thus the whole
task loop). By being the DeepAgent, the harness reuses ``_setup_task_loop`` /
``load_state`` / ``save_state`` / ``_has_remaining_tasks`` verbatim.

Round execution model: the harness shares ONE task-loop kernel and ONE stream
lifecycle for its whole life. Each outer round runs in its own asyncio.Task
that submits a round to the controller and awaits completion; the real
``react_agent.invoke`` runs inside the controller's TaskScheduler under a known
``task_id``, so an immediate abort can cancel the *scheduler* task (truly
stopping the LLM/tool work) rather than orphaning it. A single forwarder
coroutine pumps ``session.stream_iterator()`` into the output queue; the stream
is closed only by ``stop()``.

Public API surface (all methods are concurrent-safe — each just enqueues a
control event and awaits an ack resolved solely by the supervisor coroutine):
- ``start(session=None)``: configure self from the provider, build the
  task-loop kernel, start the supervisor + forwarder.
- ``stop()``: cancel any active round, stop the controller, close outputs.
- ``outputs()``: queue-backed AsyncIterator of OutputSchema chunks.
- ``send(content, immediate=False)``: immediate=True steers the active round;
  immediate=False enqueues a follow-up consumed when the round finishes.
- ``abort(immediate=False)``: graceful (round finishes, no continuation) or
  immediate (cancel scheduler task + rollback to the last round boundary).
- ``pause()``: cancel the current round, roll back to its pre-round baseline,
  and cache its query so the next send concatenates and restarts it.

        - PAUSED: ``immediate`` is ignored. ``content`` is concatenated onto the
          cached query and the merged query starts a new round.
        - TERMINATED: raises.
