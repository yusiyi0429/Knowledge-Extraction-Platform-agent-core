    ``react_agent.invoke`` runs inside the controller's TaskScheduler under
    ``task_id``.

    Attributes:
        round_id: Monotonically increasing round identifier (harness-internal).
        task_id: Scheduler task id passed into ``submit_round`` so immediate
            abort/pause can target it via ``task_scheduler.cancel_task``.
        original_query: The query that started this round (used by pause to
            cache and by send-while-paused to concatenate). An
            ``InteractiveInput`` marks a single-round interrupt resume, which
            ``_on_round_done`` settles to IDLE rather than continuing the task
            plan with the resume payload.
        deep_agent: Reference to the owning DeepAgent (the harness itself; the
            SnapshotRail reads context/state through it).
        task: The asyncio.Task running ``NativeHarness._run_round``.
        steering_queue: Pushed by ``send(immediate=True)``; reaches the inner
            ReAct loop via the round's ``submit_round`` steering wiring.
        graceful_abort: When True, the round is finishing under a graceful
            abort; ``_on_round_done`` must not auto-start a next round.
        pre_round_snapshot: Snapshot taken just before the round started
            (index 0). pause (which discards the whole round to restart with a
            merged query) and immediate abort with no completed round roll back
            to this.
        last_safe_snapshot: Most recent snapshot captured by SnapshotRail at a
            completed round iteration (AFTER_TASK_ITERATION). None until the
            first completes. immediate abort rolls back to this.
