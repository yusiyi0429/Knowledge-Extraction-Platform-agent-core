"""Stateful avatar sessions for swarmflow ``agent_session`` / ``human_session``.

Where :class:`TeamWorkerBackend` runs each ``agent()`` as a single-shot worker
(``run_once`` → ``DeepAgent.invoke`` → dispose), a *session* keeps a long-lived
:class:`TeamHarness` and drives it across many turns so context persists. Each
turn is one round on the same supervisor: ``harness.send(prompt)`` then wait for
the harness to settle back to ``IDLE`` (which absorbs any task-loop continuation
rounds), and take the last finished round's output as the turn's reply.

An *agent* session derives from the team's teammate spec (a teammate without
team tools, exactly like a worker, but multi-turn). A *human* session derives
from the human_agent spec and sources each turn's input from a real person — its
turn handling lands in a later stage; the agent path is wired here.

This object is owned by :class:`TeamWorkerBackend`, which delegates the engine's
``open_session`` / ``send_turn`` / ``close_session`` / ``aclose`` to it. It keeps
no process-global state: every session is an instance-scoped row, cleaned up on
``close_session`` / ``aclose``.
