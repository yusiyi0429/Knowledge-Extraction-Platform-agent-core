"""``run_swarmflow`` — drive a swarmflow script on the team worker backend.

This is the integration entrypoint the ``swarmflow()`` tool calls: it wires a
:class:`TeamWorkerBackend` (real LLM workers) and the caller's observer into the
engine's ``run_workflow``. ``preprocess_swarmflow`` runs the same script offline
with the deterministic ``MockBackend`` to produce the 4-layer ``WorkflowRun``
the console can preview before real execution.

The script's primitives are exposed under ``jiuwenswarm.swarmflow`` (and the
bare ``swarmflow`` the loader always maps), so a script may import either.

        observer: Receives the progress-event stream; the caller reads
            ``observer.run`` afterwards for the 4-layer structure.
        args: Value passed to the script's ``run(args)``.
        team_name: Namespacing for worker member ids.
        language: Prompt language hint.
        log_sink: Optional plain-text diagnostics sink.
        model_resolver: Optional callback resolving an ``agent(model=...)`` name
            hint to a worker ``TeamModelConfig``; ``None`` means the worker
            inherits its base spec's model.
        worker_base_spec: Base ``DeepAgentSpec`` each worker derives from (the
            team's teammate spec, or the leader spec) — gives workers
            teammate-equivalent capabilities without the team tools.
        human_base_spec: Base ``DeepAgentSpec`` for human-session avatars (the
            team's human_agent spec, or a fallback). ``None`` disables
            ``human_session`` / ``human`` (they fail clearly when used).
        build_context: Optional ``BuildContext`` from the leader harness,
            forwarded to each worker's ``NativeHarness`` build. Runtime-only
            handles such as the owner-scoped worktree manager ride in
            ``build_context.extras``.
        messager: The team messager, used by human sessions to receive a real
            person's reply on the dedicated reply topic.
        session_id: The current session id, used to build the human-reply topic.
        abort_event: Optional engine pause signal; when set mid-run, ``agent()``
            abort checkpoints raise so the run unwinds without journaling the
            in-flight call (resume reruns it). ``None`` disables pausing.
        on_backend_ready: Optional callback invoked with the constructed
            ``TeamWorkerBackend`` before the run starts — the launcher uses it to
            register a control handle (so pause can reach ``abort_sessions``).
