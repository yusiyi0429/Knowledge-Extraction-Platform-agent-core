"""The 4-layer structured representation of a swarmflow run.

``WorkflowRun`` → ``PhaseRecord`` → ``AgentActivity`` → ``{prompt, activity,
outcome}`` is the shape the TUI console renders (Phase ▸ agents ▸ one agent's
prompt / activity / outcome). It is built by replaying the engine's
:class:`WorkflowProgressEvent` stream — the preprocessing dry-run (MockBackend)
produces the same shape with zero network, so the frontend can show the planned
workflow before it executes for real.

The ``to_frontend`` transport channel is intentionally left as a stub on the
observer; this module only owns the data model and the event → model fold.
