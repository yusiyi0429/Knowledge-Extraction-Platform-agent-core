"""Structured progress events emitted by the engine during a run.

This is the engine's only observability seam beyond the plain-text ``log_sink``.
The ``phase()`` / ``log()`` primitives and the ``agent()`` start/end hooks emit
:class:`WorkflowProgressEvent` to ``Runtime.progress_sink``; an embedder
(``workflow/observer.py``) consumes them to (a) drive the leader's spectator
broadcast and (b) accumulate the 4-layer ``WorkflowRun`` structure.

The event is deliberately **business-agnostic and timestamp-free**: the engine
forbids wall-clock reads (they break deterministic resume — see ``loader``'s
determinism lint), so the embedder stamps time when it consumes an event, not
the engine when it emits one.

      on ``AGENT_STARTED`` / ``AGENT_COMPLETED`` / ``AGENT_FAILED`` so a consumer
      can group agents under their phase without tracking state.
    * ``label``               — the ``agent()`` call's label (``AGENT_*``).
    * ``prompt``              — the agent's rendered prompt (``AGENT_STARTED``).
    * ``model``               — the ``agent(model=...)`` name hint (``AGENT_STARTED``).
    * ``outcome``             — a short preview of the agent's result

    * ``message``             — free narration text (``LOG``); a human-readable
      term on ``WORKFLOW_STARTED`` / ``WORKFLOW_COMPLETED`` (e.g. "Workflow started",
      "Workflow completed"), and the error description on ``WORKFLOW_FAILED`` /
      ``AGENT_FAILED``.

      dict (``WORKFLOW_STARTED``); ``None`` on all other kinds.
    * ``correlation_id``      — a pending human turn's id (``HUMAN_PROMPT`` /
      ``HUMAN_REPLIED``), so a UI can route the person's reply back. The id is
      **deterministic** (``{phase}:{label}:{turn}``, assigned by the engine), so it
      stays valid across a resume. The event itself fires from the backend wait
      path (only when actually waiting on a person), so it is absent on cache-hit
      replays; ``HUMAN_PROMPT`` also carries ``label`` (the avatar member) and
      ``prompt`` (the question).
