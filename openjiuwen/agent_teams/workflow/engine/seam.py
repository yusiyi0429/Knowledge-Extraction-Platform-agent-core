"""The provider seam: the indirection that lets the engine be swapped.

A *provider* implements the DSL primitives. The public facade (the
``agent``/``parallel``/... a workflow script imports) does **not** call the
engine directly — it resolves the **current provider** from a ``contextvar``
and forwards to it. The engine installs its
:class:`~workflow.engine.provider.EngineProvider` for the duration of a run; a
different implementation (a distributed engine, an in-process simulator, a
record/replay shim) can install its own provider instead, and **workflow
scripts never change** — they import the same names from the facade.

Because the provider lives in a ``contextvar`` and ``asyncio`` Tasks copy the
context, concurrent runs in one event loop can even use *different* providers
without interfering.
