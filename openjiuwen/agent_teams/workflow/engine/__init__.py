"""workflow.engine — the **internal** reference engine behind SwarmFlow.

A faithful, business-agnostic port of the dw/wf deterministic asyncio engine.
It is *not* the public surface: workflow scripts import from the facade (mapped
to the bare name ``swarmflow`` at runtime), and the engine installs itself as
the active *provider* (see :mod:`workflow.engine.provider` /
:mod:`workflow.engine.seam`) when you call ``run_workflow``. Swapping engines
means installing a different provider; scripts never name this package.

The team integration (``TeamWorkerBackend``, the observer, the ``swarmflow()``
tool) lives in the parent ``workflow`` package — this engine subpackage stays
free of any agent_teams import so it can be unit-tested in isolation with the
``MockBackend``.
