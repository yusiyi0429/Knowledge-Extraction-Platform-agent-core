"""The structured-output tool an agent calls to return a schema-conforming result.

The harness has no native structured-output / ``response_format`` mechanism, so
an agent that must produce schema-conforming output is given this tool with its
``ToolCard.input_params`` set to the exact JSON Schema the caller requested. The
LLM is instructed to finish by calling ``structured_output`` with the result
object; the call's arguments — validated against the schema by the model's
tool-use machinery — are captured here for the caller to read back.

Used by both swarmflow workers/sessions and tiny agents. One instance is
constructed per call (the schema differs each time), so the captured value is
single-use and lives on the instance.
