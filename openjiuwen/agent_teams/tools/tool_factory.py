    Args:
        role: "leader" or "teammate".
        agent_team: AgentTeam instance providing task/message/db/messager.
        teammate_mode: Execution mode for teammates — "build_mode" or
            "plan_mode". Leader's approval tools (approve_plan / approve_tool)
            are only wired when teammate_mode == "plan_mode", since that's the
            only mode where teammates submit plans and tool calls can be held
            for leader sign-off.
        lifecycle: Team lifecycle — "temporary" or "persistent". The
            ``clean_team`` tool is only wired for temporary teams; persistent
            teams are torn down through operator-level SDK facades
            (``delete_agent_team`` etc.), so exposing a leader-callable
            tear-down tool inside a round would race the pool invariants.
        on_teammate_created: Callback invoked when a teammate is created.
        model_config_allocator: Callback that returns the next
            ``Allocation`` for teammate allocation. Receives an
            optional ``model_name`` hint forwarded from the spawn site;
            ``RoundRobinModelAllocator`` ignores the hint while
            ``ByModelNameAllocator`` requires it.
        exclude_tools: Tool names to exclude from the allowed set.
        lang: Locale code ("cn" or "en") for tool descriptions.
        parent_agent: The owning ``NativeHarness`` (a ``DeepAgent``) that the
            leader-only async ``swarmflow`` tool launches background work on.
            Supplied at rail-init time; None for callers without a harness
            (e.g. external CLI members), which never get ``swarmflow`` anyway.
        messager: The member's messager — the ``swarmflow`` tool uses it to
            publish phase-progress events for the spectator leader.
        team_name: Team name used for swarmflow event routing / worker ids.
        swarmflow_model_resolver: Resolves an ``agent(model=...)`` name hint to a
            worker ``Model``. Non-None only for a leader whose spec has
            ``enable_swarmflow``; when None the ``swarmflow`` tool is gated out.
