            db: TeamDatabase.
            messager: Messager instance for event publishing.
            teammate_mode: Default execution mode for spawned teammates.
            predefined_members: Pre-configured teammates to register
                during ``build_team``.
            model_config_allocator: Callback that returns the next
                ``Allocation`` for teammate allocation. Receives an
                optional ``model_name`` hint forwarded from the spawn
                site (predefined member spec or ``spawn_member`` tool
                argument); ``RoundRobinModelAllocator`` ignores the
                hint, ``ByModelNameAllocator`` requires it.
            leader_allocation: Pre-allocated ``Allocation`` for the
                leader member. Persisted on the leader's DB row in
                ``build_team`` as ``{model_name, model_index}`` so the

                recovery via positional lookup against the live pool.
            enable_hitt: Spec-level HITT capability ceiling. When
                False, every human-agent spawn path returns failure;
                when True, the runtime instance flag (mutated by
                ``build_team``) decides whether the capability is
                actually engaged.
            enable_bridge: Spec-level Bridge-Agent capability ceiling.
                Symmetric to ``enable_hitt`` for the bridge feature.
                When False, ``spawn_bridge_agent`` returns failure and
                predefined BRIDGE_AGENT members are skipped at
                ``build_team`` time.
            external_cli_agents: Static launch configs for external CLI
                agents (``TeamAgentSpec.external_cli_agents``). The
                non-empty set of declared ``cli_agent`` names is the
                capability ceiling for external-CLI members:
                ``spawn_external_cli_agent`` rejects any ``cli_agent`` not
                declared here.
            on_before_team_cleaned: Optional async callback fired on the
                ``clean_team`` SUCCESS path before the team DB row is
                deleted. Use this for cleanup that still needs member rows
                and their metadata, such as session-scoped worktree finalize.
            on_team_cleaned: Optional async callback fired exactly once
                on the ``clean_team`` SUCCESS path. NOT fired on the early
                ``return False`` path (active members remain). The hosting
                ``TeamAgent`` wires this to ``_mark_team_cleaned`` so the
                leader's StreamController can end the round
                deterministically — the racy ``on_cleaned`` bus event is
                deliberately not relied on for the leader.
                The callback is invoked immediately after the team DB row
                is deleted, before best-effort cleanup and event publishing.

                ``build_team`` creates the team row and initial members.
