"""Process-global i18n for agent team runtime strings.

Houses hard-coded user-facing strings that live inside runtime code paths
(dispatcher nudges, backend message content, default persona) so they can
be switched between Chinese and English without source edits.

Modules that already carry their own bilingual dictionaries
(``prompts/sections.py``, ``prompts/policy.py``) or Markdown-backed
descriptions (``tools/locales/``) are intentionally NOT routed through
this module — they accept a ``language`` argument at call time and
should continue to do so.

Usage:

    from openjiuwen.agent_teams.i18n import set_language, t

    set_language("en")
    msg = t("dispatcher.member_online", target_id="dev-1")
