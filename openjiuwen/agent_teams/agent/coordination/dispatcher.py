"""Event dispatcher for TeamAgent coordination events.

Trigger rules (coarse filters: agent_ready, inner-vs-transport, role
gating) live here; behavior lives in scenario-scoped handlers under
:mod:`coordination.handlers`. Each handler exposes ``get_callbacks()``
yielding the ``event_key -> bound method`` mapping that we feed to a
private :class:`AsyncCallbackFramework` instance. Multiple handlers
may register the same ``event_key`` — the framework fans out callbacks
in registration order (sorted stably by ``priority=0``).

Note on exception semantics: ``AsyncCallbackFramework.trigger()``
swallows callback exceptions (logs + continues), unlike the previous
fail-fast dispatch. Handlers must log their own errors via
``team_logger.error(..., exc_info=True)`` rather than relying on
framework swallowing as silent error handling.
