"""Member-lifecycle coordination events.

Handles all six ``MEMBER_*`` events. Leader observes every member's
transitions; teammate only reacts to events targeting itself
(``MEMBER_CANCELED`` cancels the local round). The on-shutdown
mailbox drain is **not** this handler's concern — ``MessageHandler``
registers its own ``MEMBER_SHUTDOWN`` callback and the framework
fans out both, so this handler stays scoped to lifecycle state only.
