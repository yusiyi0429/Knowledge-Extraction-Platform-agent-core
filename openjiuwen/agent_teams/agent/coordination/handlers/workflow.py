"""Swarmflow progress handler — narrate orchestration progress to the leader.

A swarmflow run (launched by the ``swarmflow()`` tool, executing in the leader's
process) publishes ``WORKFLOW_PROGRESS`` events on the team topic with a
non-leader ``sender_id`` so the leader's own coordination loop receives them
(``kernel`` only self-filters events whose ``sender_id`` equals the local
member name). This handler turns the phase / start / completion milestones into
a short narration line and feeds it to the leader via ``deliver_input`` — the
spectator leader then streams a user-facing report. Per-agent progress is
intentionally NOT narrated (too chatty); it lives in the 4-layer ``WorkflowRun``
the observer accumulates.

Mirrors the established TaskBoard / Message handler pattern: the event only
reaches the leader's DeepAgent as input — coordination makes no decision here.
