"""Team-completion coordination events.

Drives and consumes the team-completion lifecycle. Two responsibilities:

* On ``POLL_TASK`` ticks (leader only, when the leader is idle): evaluate
  the three team-completion conditions via ``TeamBackend.is_team_completed``
  and emit ``TEAM_COMPLETED`` once per rising edge.
* On ``TASK_LIST_DRAINED``: log it and fire every registered completion
  callback. ``TeamAgent`` wires ``TeamSkillRail.notify_team_completed`` in
  here once after the DeepAgent is built (see
  ``register_completion_callback``), so a drained board triggers team-skill
  evolution without waiting for a ``view_task`` call and without a
  per-event rail lookup.
* On ``TEAM_COMPLETED``: consume the event with a structured log — the hook
  point for a future SDK-facing notification.

Evaluation runs on the poll tick rather than reacting to member-status
events because ``kernel._filter_self`` drops the leader's own
``MemberStatusChangedEvent`` — the leader cannot observe its own settle,
so the periodic idle tick is the reliable leader-idle hook.
