        The sender's original content goes verbatim inside the
        ``<team-inbound>`` element (sender / message_id / type / time as
        attributes), and the framework-added hint goes in a separate
        ``<team-note>`` — so the LLM sees a clean boundary between the
        original message and what the runtime appended. ``message_id`` is
        carried so the agent can call ``mark_message_read``; the send time
        is rendered as ``<absolute local time> (<relative diff>)`` so the
        agent can judge recency (mailbox delivery is often delayed).

        Rendering is role-aware. A teammate / leader gets a
        ``reply-hint`` note. A human_agent avatar gets ``for="controller"``
        plus a ``hitt-silence`` note: the message is framed as a
        notification for the controlling human, and the load-bearing
        "stay silent" constraint keeps the avatar from autonomously
        calling ``send_message`` — its outbound actions are driven only by
        Inbox instructions from its controller.

        Args:
            msg: The team message row to render.
            is_human_agent: Whether the recipient is a human-agent avatar.
