"""MemberRuntime: the brain seam behind a team member.

``StreamController`` / coordination / the configurator drive a member's
"brain" exclusively through this surface. :class:`~openjiuwen.agent_teams.harness.TeamHarness`
(NativeHarness/DeepAgent-backed) is the default implementation; an external
CLI agent is driven by ``ExternalCliRuntime`` / ``ReinvokeCliRuntime``
implementing the same Protocol. Capturing the contract here lets the runtime
be swapped without business-code changes.

The interaction surface mirrors :class:`~openjiuwen.agent_teams.harness.HarnessProtocol`
(``start`` / ``stop`` / ``outputs`` / ``send`` / ``abort`` / ``pause`` /
``subscribe`` / ``state`` / ``session_id``): one cycle is
started per ``coordination.start`` and torn down at ``finalize_round``. Inputs
arrive through ``send`` (``immediate`` steers the active round); the producing
side fires phase/round events the StreamController maps onto
MemberStatus / ExecutionStatus.

Only members actually accessed on a runtime *instance* are declared. Rail /
memory hooks are present because the default DeepAgent path uses
them; an external runtime that skips those features implements them as no-ops
(the configurator never invokes them for such members).
