"""Spawn an external CLI agent as an in-process team member.

Mirrors :func:`inprocess_spawn`, but the member's brain is a third-party CLI
subprocess driven by an ``ExternalCliRuntime`` instead of a local DeepAgent.
The TeamAgent shell (coordination, mailbox, member handle) runs in the
current process; the CLI binary is the only separate process. The runtime is
built before ``configure`` (the subprocess launch is async) and injected so
the configurator skips DeepAgent / rail / memory setup.
