"""Human-agent-side inbox: dumb router for typed ``HumanAgentMessage`` payloads.

The inbox does **not** parse the body — the top-layer
``parse_interact_str`` already turned ``@<member>`` / ``@all`` / ``$<name>``
syntax into structured payloads. ``send`` only routes based on the
explicit ``to`` argument:

* ``to is None`` → enqueue the body into the matching avatar's own
  coordination as user input (``interact`` → ``USER_INPUT`` event); the
  avatar consumes it after its harness has started. No bus message.
* ``to in BROADCAST_TARGETS`` (``"all"`` / ``"*"``) → broadcast as the
  human-agent ``sender``.
* ``to=<member>`` → validate the target and post a point-to-point bus
  message from ``sender``.

Sender resolution stays here: a team with a single human-agent member
can omit ``sender``, and we still want unknown senders to raise
``UnknownHumanAgentError`` rather than silently injecting a rogue
identity into the message log.
