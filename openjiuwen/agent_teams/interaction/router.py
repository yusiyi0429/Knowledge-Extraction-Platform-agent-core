"""Top-layer parser for ``interact(str, ...)`` user input.

The runtime keeps mention/channel parsing in exactly one place — here.
Inboxes and the ``_dispatch_payload`` switch consume already-typed
:class:`InteractPayload` values; they never re-parse the body.

Grammar
-------

::

    input := channel? recipients? body
    channel := "# " | "$" name (" " | "@")  # default "# " when absent
    recipients := ("@" name " ")*           # zero or more
    body := <remaining text after consuming channel + recipients>

* ``# body`` — god-view; body lands on the leader's DeepAgent.
* ``$<name> body`` — drive ``<name>``'s human-agent avatar.
* ``@<member> body`` — point-to-point bus traffic to ``<member>`` from
  the channel sender (``user`` for ``#``, ``<name>`` for ``$``).
* ``@all body`` / ``@* body`` — broadcast on the channel.
* ``@<m1> @<m2> body`` — multi-cast: one bus message per recipient.
* ``<bare body>`` — defaults to ``# <bare body>``.

Whitespace separates every prefix from its body — ``#hashtag`` and
``$variable`` are content, not channel markers, because they lack the
trailing space the grammar requires.
