"""External interaction layer for agent teams.

Home for the two parallel input channels the runtime exposes:

* ``UserInbox`` — the external caller ("user"). Delivers input to the
  leader's DeepAgent by default; ``@member_name`` hops the leader and
  posts directly to the named member.
* ``HumanAgentInbox`` — the reserved ``human_agent`` team member. Only
  available when HITT is enabled; every call is dispatched as a
  ``send_message`` from ``human_agent``.

The mention parser lives here as a pure function so it is independently
testable — it used to sit inline in ``dispatcher.py`` with regex
literals scattered across methods.

For bridge-agent members (a teammate paired with a remote independent
agent reachable over a pure-text protocol) the framework auto-forwards
mailbox messages through ``BridgeProtocolAdapter`` on the recipient's
behalf — there is no user-facing inbox class; the bridge avatar is a
normal teammate from the team's point of view.
