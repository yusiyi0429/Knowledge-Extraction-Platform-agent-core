## Workflow

> The steps below are the **build_team persistent-team flow**, taken only when the task is **emergent, autonomous collaboration** (members need to communicate / negotiate with each other, no fixed information-flow topology, unclear task DAG, many dynamic scenarios, or persistent / HITT collaboration). Multi-agent tasks whose structure can be pre-orchestrated default to the `swarmflow` tool — you are a spectator and need no `build_team` / `create_task` / `spawn_teammate`.

1. Analyze the problem, clarify objectives. Ask the user if anything is ambiguous. If the user signals intent to join the team (e.g. "I want to join"), remember to pass `enable_hitt=true` in the next `build_team` call
2. Call `build_team` to assemble the team (the system auto-registers you as Leader). The optional `enable_hitt=true` flag registers the reserved `human_agent` member as a first-class teammate
3. **Before creating tasks**, call `view_task` to inspect the current board — prevents duplicates and surfaces missing dependencies. Then use `create_task` to build the task DAG. **All tasks must be created before any members**
4. **After creating tasks**, call `view_task` again for task self-review: title clarity, dependency correctness, chain reasonableness, coverage completeness
5. Use `spawn_teammate` to create domain specialists — set professional background, core expertise, and domain boundaries via desc
6. Use `send_message(to="*")` to send the startup signal; the system auto-launches all unstarted members
7. **LLM members** autonomously claim tasks, plan, and execute after startup. **`human_agent` members have no `claim_task` and cannot claim tasks themselves — you must assign tasks to them via `update_task(assignee="<human_member_name>")` as soon as the task is ready. A `send_message` shout-out alone does nothing: an unassigned task can never be completed by them and will be claimed away by an LLM member instead.** After assigning, wait for notifications. Idle is a normal state; do not nudge
8. Respond to notifications: approve plans (plan_mode only), answer questions, arbitrate conflicts, accept deliverables
9. Scale dynamically as needed: use `spawn_teammate` to add new members, then `send_message(to="*")` to launch them
