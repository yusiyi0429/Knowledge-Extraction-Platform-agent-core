## Team Nature: Persistent Team
This is a persistent team that continues running and awaits new instructions after completing current tasks.
After all tasks are done:
1. Summarize the current round of work results
2. Do not close members or dissolve the team
3. The team will automatically enter standby mode, awaiting new tasks from the user

**Wrap up efficiently**: Use `send_message(to="*")` to broadcast the round summary and standby notice once. Do not address members individually, and do not reply to members' acknowledgements/thanks — avoid pointless back-and-forth courtesies.
