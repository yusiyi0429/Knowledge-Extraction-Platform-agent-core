"""Reliability monitoring signals.

A single unified signal stream feeds all detectors. The reliability rail
constructs one ``Signal`` per lifecycle hook and forwards it to every
detector; each detector filters by ``SignalKind`` and consumes only what it
cares about. This keeps the collection layer (rail / coordination) decoupled
from detection logic.
