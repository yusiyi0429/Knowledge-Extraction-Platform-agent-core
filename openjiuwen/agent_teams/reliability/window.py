"""Sliding-window counters and stable call hashing for detectors.

Shared algorithm utilities:
  - ``SlidingWindowCounter``: time-bucketed event counting for error-rate /
    frequency sampling. Avoids the boundary spikes of fixed windows.
  - ``stable_call_hash``: order-independent hash of a tool call so that
    ``{"a": 1, "b": 2}`` and ``{"b": 2, "a": 1}`` collide, preventing repeat
    detection from missing reordered-argument calls.
