"""Worktree data models.

Pydantic models for worktree configuration, session state, creation results,
and change summaries.

Owner identification fields (``member_name`` / ``team_name``) are kept for
backwards compatibility with existing persistence and tests; semantically
they are generic ``owner_id`` / ``tag`` markers and may be left ``None`` by
single-agent callers.
