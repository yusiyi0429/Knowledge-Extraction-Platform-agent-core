"""Worktree backend protocol and git implementation.

Pluggable backend for worktree creation and removal. The default
``GitBackend`` uses native git worktree commands with a four-phase
creation flow: fast recovery, base resolution, worktree add, and
optional sparse checkout.

Custom backends (e.g. distributed cross-machine isolation) are
registered via :func:`register_worktree_backend` and selected by
name through :func:`create_backend`.
