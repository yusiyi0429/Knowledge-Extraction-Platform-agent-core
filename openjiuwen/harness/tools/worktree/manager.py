"""Worktree lifecycle manager.

Coordinates worktree creation, removal, session state, post-creation
setup, event dispatch, and rail dispatch. This is the single business
logic entry point — tools and spawn code delegate here.

The manager is owner-agnostic: callers (team framework, single agent,
custom orchestrators) provide an optional ``event_handler`` that receives
generic ``WorktreeCreatedEvent`` / ``WorktreeRemovedEvent`` payloads and
translates them into whatever transport their system uses. The team
framework, for instance, subscribes to these events to maintain a
``{team_workspace}/.worktree/{slug}`` symlink view of active worktrees.
Single-agent callers have no such view requirement and simply ignore the
events.

    Responsibilities:
    - Create/remove worktrees via backend
    - Manage session state (ContextVar)
    - Post-creation setup (symlinks for ``symlink_directories`` and
      gitignored include files inside the worktree itself)
    - Dispatch lifecycle events to caller-provided handler
    - Change detection before removal
    - Rail dispatch for lifecycle hooks

    The manager intentionally does NOT manage any
    ``{workspace}/.worktree/{slug}`` view symlink — that is a team
    workspace concern handled by ``TeamWorkspaceManager`` via the
    ``event_handler`` callback. Keeping that responsibility out of here
    preserves single-agent semantics (no extra symlink layer) and avoids
    teaching this generic component about caller-specific layouts.
